### REST and SOAP API testing in Postman
1. According to the first task i tested all methods that are provided for https://petstore.swagger.io/ in Postman and created the <a href="https://www.postman.com/avionics-administrator-41813831/workspace/test-workspace/collection/24355547-bd191190-4e9b-44d0-abc0-76926b6e9673?action=share&creator=24355547">corresponding Postamn collection for the petstore : REST</a>

    Also i had to :
    - Write a test that checks the status code after removing the pet from the database;
    - Create multiple users using createdWithArray;
    - In the request body for creating a pet, make dynamic values that will be automatically generated upon submission.

    Solution to the second part of the first task is located in "Tests and array" folder in the same collection
